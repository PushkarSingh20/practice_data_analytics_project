ðŸ“Š End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Python & SQL

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python and SQL. We utilize the **Kaggle API** to download a sales dataset, perform data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**, and load the cleaned data into **SQL Server**. Finally, we run several SQL queries to answer key business questions and extract insights.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded a sales dataset using the Kaggle API.

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using Python and Pandas.  
   - Ensured data types and formats were consistent for SQL analysis.

3. **Database Loading**  
   - Loaded the processed data into SQL Server for querying.

4. **Data Analysis using SQL**  
   - Identified **top 5 selling products by region**.
   - Compared **monthly sales between 2022 and 2023**.
   - Found the **month with the highest sales for each product category**.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `SQLQuery1.sql`: Contains all the SQL queries used for analysis.
- `notebook.ipynb` *(optional)*: Jupyter Notebook (if used) for data processing and loading.

## ðŸ“Œ Key SQL Concepts Used

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Aggregate Functions** (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`)
- **Window Functions** (`ROW_NUMBER()`)
- **Conditional Aggregation** (`CASE WHEN`)
- **Date Formatting and Filtering**

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Gained

- Regional product sales trends.
- Sales growth comparison between years.
- Category-level performance over time.
